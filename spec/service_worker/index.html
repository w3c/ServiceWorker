  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This specification describes a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing, including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline.</p>

  <p>The core of this system is an event-driven <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/">Web Worker</a>, which responds to events dispatched from documents and other sources. A system for managing installation, versions, and upgrades is provided.</p>

  <p>The service worker is a generic entry point for event-driven background processing in the Web Platform that is <a href="#extensibility">extensible by other specifications</a>.</p>

    <p>All diagrams, examples, notes, are non-normative, as well as sections explicitly marked as non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/xbl2/#refsRFC2119">RFC2119</a>. For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.</p>

    <p>Any point, at which a conforming UA must make decisions about the state or reaction to the state of the conceptual model, is captured as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a>. The algorithms are defined in terms of processing equivalence. The <dfn id="dfn-processing-equivalence">processing equivalence</dfn> is a constraint imposed on the algorithm implementers, requiring the output of the both UA-implemented and the specified algorithm to be exactly the same for all inputs.</p>

    <h1>Motivations</h1>

    <p>Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable. This assumption pervades the platform. HTML documents are loaded over HTTP and traditionally fetch all of their sub-resources via subsequent HTTP requests. This places web content at a disadvantage versus other technology stacks.</p>

    <p>The <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> is designed first to redress this balance by providing a Web Worker context, which can be started by a runtime when navigations are about to occur. This event-driven worker is registered against an origin and a path (or pattern), meaning it can be consulted when navigations occur to that location. Events that correspond to network requests are dispatched to the worker and the responses generated by the worker may over-ride default network stack behavior. This puts the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a>, conceptually, between the network and a document renderer, allowing the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> to provide content for documents, even while offline.</p>

    <p>Web developers familiar with previous attempts to solve the offline problem have reported a deficit of flexibility in those solutions. As a result, the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> is highly procedural, providing a maximum of flexibility at the price of additional complexity for developers. Part of this complexity arises from the need to keep <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> responsive in the face of a single-threaded execution model. As a result, APIs exposed by <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> are almost entirely asynchronous, a pattern familiar in other JavaScript contexts but accentuated here by the need to avoid blocking document and resource loading.</p>

    <p>Developers using the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#offline">HTML5 Application Cache</a> have also <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag">reported that several attributes</a> of the design contribute to <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag/index.html#section6">unrecoverable errors</a>. A key design principle of the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> is that errors should <em>always</em> be recoverable. Many details of the update process of <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> are designed to avoid these hazards.</p>

    <p><a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> are started and kept alive by their relationship to events, not documents. This design borrows heavily from developer and vendor experience with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#sharedworker">Shared Workers</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages">Chrome Background Pages</a>. A key lesson from these systems is the necessity to time-limit the execution of background processing contexts, both to conserve resources and to ensure that background context loss and restart is top-of-mind for developers. As a result, <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> bear more than a passing resemblance to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages">Chrome Event Pages</a>, the successor to Background Pages. <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> may be started by user agents <em>without an attached document</em> and may be killed by the user agent at nearly any time. Conceptually, <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> can be thought of as Shared Workers that can start, process events, and die without ever handling messages from documents. Developers are advised to keep in mind that <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> may be started and killed many times a second.</p>

    <p><a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> are generic, event-driven, time-limited script contexts that run at an origin. These properties make them natural endpoints for a range of runtime services that may outlive the context of a particular document, e.g. handling push notifications, background data synchronization, responding to resource requests from other origins, or receiving centralized updates to expensive-to-calculate data (e.g., geolocation or gyroscope).</p>

      <p>The <code><a href="#cache-interface">Cache</a></code> instances are not part of the browser's HTTP cache. The <code><a href="#cache-interface">Cache</a></code> objects are exactly what authors have to manage themselves.

That is, caches are not updated automatically. Updates must be manually managed.

  <spec-section id="cross-origin-resources">
    <h1>Cross-Origin Resources &amp; CORS</h1>

    <p>Applications tend to cache items that come from a CDN or other domain. It is possible to request many of them directly using &lt;script&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;video&gt; and &lt;link&gt; elements. It would be hugely limiting if this sort of runtime collaboration broke when offline. Similarly, it is possible to XHR many sorts of off-domain resources when appropriate CORS headers are set.</p>
    <p>ServiceWorkers enable this by allowing <code><a href="#cache-interface">Cache</a></code>s to fetch and cache off-origin items. Some restrictions apply, however. First, unlike same-origin resources which are managed in the <code><a href="#cache-interface">Cache</a></code> as <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code> objects with the <code>type</code> attribute set to "<code>basic</code>", the objects stored are <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code> objects with the <code>type</code> attribute set to "<code>opaque</code>". <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code>s typed "<code>opaque</code>" provide a much less expressive API than <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code>s typed "<code>basic</code>"; the bodies and headers cannot be read or set, nor many of the other aspects of their content inspected. They can be passed to <code><a href="#fetch-event-respondwith-method">event.respondWith(<var>r</var>)</a></code> method and <code><a href="#FIXME(jungkees)">event.forwardTo(<var>url</var>)</a></code> method in the same manner as the <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code>s typed "<code>basic</code>", but cannot be meaningfully created programmatically. These limitations are necessary to preserve the security invariants of the platform. Allowing <code><a href="#cache-interface">Cache</a></code>s to store them allows applications to avoid re-architecting in most cases.</p>

  <!-- FIXME: INCOMPLETE!! Please add collaborators below. -->

  <p>Jake Archibald is a ghost-author of this document. The best instincts in the design are his. He similarly shaped many of the details through discussion and experimentation. The bits which are not his (but which are good) owe everything to his experience, persistence, and focus on enabling web developers. He embodies a hopeful example for developers in shaping browser efforts to more directly address real-world pain points. If service workers solve "offline for the web", the credit is due him.</p>

  <p>Deep thanks go to Andrew Betts for organizing and hosting a small workshop of like-minded individuals including: Jake Archibald, Jackson Gabbard, Tobie Langel, Robin Berjon, Patrick Lauke, Christian Heilmann. From the clarity of the day's discussions and the use-cases outlined there, much has become possible. Further thanks to Andrew for raising consciousness about the offline problem. His organization of EdgeConf and inclusion of Offline as a persistent topic there has created many opportunities and connections that have enabled this work to progress.</p>

  <p>Anne van Kesteren has generously lent his encyclopedic knowledge of Web Platform arcana and standards development experience throughout the development of the service worker. This specification would be incomplete without his previous work in describing the real-world behavior of URLs, HTTP Fetch, Promises, and DOM. Similarly, this specification would not be possible without Ian Hickson's rigorous Web Worker spec. Much thanks to him.</p>

  <p>In no particular order, deep gratitude for design guidance and discussion goes to: Jungkee Song, Alec Flett, David Barrett-Kahn, Aaron Boodman, Michael Nordman, Tom Ashworth, Kinuko Yasuda, Darin Fisher, Jonas Sicking, Jesús Leganés Combarro, Mark Christian, Dave Hermann, Yehuda Katz, François Remy, Ilya Grigorik, Will Chan, Domenic Denicola, Nikhil Marathe, Yves Lafon, Adam Barth, Greg Simon, Devdatta Akhawe, Dominic Cooney, Jeffrey Yasskin, Joshua Bell, Boris Zbarsky, Matt Falkenhagen, Tobie Langel, Gavin Peters, and Ben Kelly.</p>

  <p>Jason Weber, Chris Wilson, Paul Kinlan, Ehsan Akhgari, and Daniel Austin have provided valuable, well-timed feedback on requirements and the standardization process.</p>

  <p>The authors would also like to thank Dimitri Glazkov for his scripts and formatting tools which have been essential in the production of this specification. The authors are also grateful for his considerable guidance.</p>

  <p>Thanks also to Vivian Cromwell, Greg Simon, Alex Komoroske, and Wonsuk Lee for their considerable professional support.</p>
