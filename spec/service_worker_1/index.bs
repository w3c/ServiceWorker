  <h2 id='motivations'>Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    <p>Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable. This assumption pervades the platform. HTML documents are loaded over HTTP and traditionally fetch all of their sub-resources via subsequent HTTP requests. This places web content at a disadvantage versus other technology stacks.</p>

    <p>The <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> is designed first to redress this balance by providing a Web Worker context, which can be started by a runtime when navigations are about to occur. This event-driven worker is registered against an origin and a path (or pattern), meaning it can be consulted when navigations occur to that location. Events that correspond to network requests are dispatched to the worker and the responses generated by the worker may override default network stack behavior. This puts the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a>, conceptually, between the network and a document renderer, allowing the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> to provide content for documents, even while offline.</p>

    <p>Web developers familiar with previous attempts to solve the offline problem have reported a deficit of flexibility in those solutions. As a result, the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> is highly procedural, providing a maximum of flexibility at the price of additional complexity for developers. Part of this complexity arises from the need to keep <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> responsive in the face of a single-threaded execution model. As a result, APIs exposed by <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> are almost entirely asynchronous, a pattern familiar in other JavaScript contexts but accentuated here by the need to avoid blocking document and resource loading.</p>

    <p>Developers using the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#offline">HTML5 Application Cache</a> have also <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag">reported that several attributes</a> of the design contribute to <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag/index.html#section6">unrecoverable errors</a>. A key design principle of the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> is that errors should <em>always</em> be recoverable. Many details of the update process of <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> are designed to avoid these hazards.</p>

    <p><a href="#dfn-service-worker">Service workers</a> are started and kept alive by their relationship to events, not documents. This design borrows heavily from developer and vendor experience with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#sharedworker">Shared Workers</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages">Chrome Background Pages</a>. A key lesson from these systems is the necessity to time-limit the execution of background processing contexts, both to conserve resources and to ensure that background context loss and restart is top-of-mind for developers. As a result, <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> bear more than a passing resemblance to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages">Chrome Event Pages</a>, the successor to Background Pages. <a href="#dfn-service-worker">Service workers</a> may be started by user agents <em>without an attached document</em> and may be killed by the user agent at nearly any time. Conceptually, <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> can be thought of as Shared Workers that can start, process events, and die without ever handling messages from documents. Developers are advised to keep in mind that <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a> may be started and killed many times a second.</p>

    <p><a href="#dfn-service-worker">Service workers</a> are generic, event-driven, time-limited script contexts that run at an origin. These properties make them natural endpoints for a range of runtime services that may outlive the context of a particular document, e.g. handling push notifications, background data synchronization, responding to resource requests from other origins, or receiving centralized updates to expensive-to-calculate data (e.g., geolocation or gyroscope).</p>

    <p>The {{Cache}} instances are not part of the browser's HTTP cache. The {{Cache}} objects are exactly what authors have to manage themselves. The {{Cache}} objects do not get updated unless authors explicitly request them to be. The {{Cache}} objects do not expire unless authors delete the entries. The {{Cache}} objects do not disappear just because the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a> script is updated. That is, caches are not updated automatically.

    <h3 id="cross-origin-resources">Cross-Origin Resources and CORS</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    <p>Applications tend to cache items that come from a CDN or other <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#origin-2">origin</a>. It is possible to request many of them directly using <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements. It would be hugely limiting if this sort of runtime collaboration broke when offline. Similarly, it is possible to <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> many sorts of off-<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#origin-2">origin</a> resources when appropriate CORS headers are set.</p>
    <p><a href="#dfn-service-worker">Service workers</a> enable this by allowing {{Cache|Caches}} to <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> and cache off-origin items. Some restrictions apply, however. First, unlike same-origin resources which are managed in the {{Cache}} as <code><a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code> objects whose corresponding <a href="#concept-response-response">responses</a> are <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-filtered-response-basic">basic filtered response</a>, the objects stored are <code><a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code> objects whose corresponding <a href="#concept-response-response">responses</a> are either <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-filtered-response-cors">CORS filtered responses</a> or <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-filtered-response-opaque">opaque filtered responses</a>. They can be passed to {{FetchEvent/respondWith(r)|event.respondWith(r)}} method in the same manner as the <code><a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code> objects whose corresponding <a href="#concept-response-response">responses</a> are <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-filtered-response-basic">basic filtered responses</a>, but cannot be meaningfully created programmatically. These limitations are necessary to preserve the security invariants of the platform. Allowing {{Cache|Caches}} to store them allows applications to avoid re-architecting in most cases.</p>

    <p>The implementers are encouraged to note:
      <ul>
        <li>Plug-ins should not load via <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a>.

        <li>Some of the legacy networking stack code may need to be carefully audited to understand the ramifications of interactions with <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a>.</li>

    <p>An HTTP response to a <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a>'s <a href="#dfn-script-resource">script resource</a> request can include the following <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-header">header</a>:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>`<dfn><code>Service-Worker-Allowed</code></dfn>`</dt>
      <dd>Indicates the user agent will override the path restriction, which limits the maximum allowed <a href="#dfn-scope-url">scope url</a> that the script can <a href="#dfn-control">control</a>, to the given value.
        <p class="note">The value is a URL. If a relative URL is given, it is parsed against the script's URL.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="example">
      Default scope:

  <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
  <!-- FIXME: INCOMPLETE!! Please add collaborators below. -->
  <p>Deep thanks go to Andrew Betts for organizing and hosting a small workshop of like-minded individuals including: Jake Archibald, Jackson Gabbard, Tobie Langel, Robin Berjon, Patrick Lauke, Christian Heilmann. From the clarity of the day's discussions and the use-cases outlined there, much has become possible. Further thanks to Andrew for raising consciousness about the offline problem. His organization of EdgeConf and inclusion of Offline as a persistent topic there has created many opportunities and connections that have enabled this work to progress.</p>

  <p>Anne van Kesteren has generously lent his encyclopedic knowledge of Web Platform arcana and standards development experience throughout the development of the service worker. This specification would be incomplete without his previous work in describing the real-world behavior of URLs, HTTP Fetch, Promises, and DOM. Similarly, this specification would not be possible without Ian Hickson's rigorous Web Worker spec. Much thanks to him.</p>

  <p>In no particular order, deep gratitude for design guidance and discussion goes to: Jungkee Song, Alec Flett, David Barrett-Kahn, Aaron Boodman, Michael Nordman, Tom Ashworth, Kinuko Yasuda, Darin Fisher, Jonas Sicking, Jesús Leganés Combarro, Mark Christian, Dave Hermann, Yehuda Katz, François Remy, Ilya Grigorik, Will Chan, Domenic Denicola, Nikhil Marathe, Yves Lafon, Adam Barth, Greg Simon, Devdatta Akhawe, Dominic Cooney, Jeffrey Yasskin, Joshua Bell, Boris Zbarsky, Matt Falkenhagen, Tobie Langel, Gavin Peters, Ben Kelly, Hiroki Nakagawa, Jake Archibald, Josh Soref and Jinho Bang.</p>

  <p>Jason Weber, Chris Wilson, Paul Kinlan, Ehsan Akhgari, and Daniel Austin have provided valuable, well-timed feedback on requirements and the standardization process.</p>

  <p>The authors would also like to thank Dimitri Glazkov for his scripts and formatting tools which have been essential in the production of this specification. The authors are also grateful for his considerable guidance.</p>

  <p>Thanks also to Vivian Cromwell, Greg Simon, Alex Komoroske, Wonsuk Lee, and Seojin Kim for their considerable professional support.</p>
