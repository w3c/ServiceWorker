  <h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>

  *This section is non-normative.*
  
  Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable. This assumption pervades the platform. HTML documents are loaded over HTTP and traditionally fetch all of their sub-resources via subsequent HTTP requests. This places web content at a disadvantage versus other technology stacks.

  The <a>service worker</a> is designed first to redress this balance by providing a Web Worker context, which can be started by a runtime when navigations are about to occur. This event-driven worker is registered against an origin and a path (or pattern), meaning it can be consulted when navigations occur to that location. Events that correspond to network requests are dispatched to the worker and the responses generated by the worker may override default network stack behavior. This puts the <a>service worker</a>, conceptually, between the network and a document renderer, allowing the <a>service worker</a> to provide content for documents, even while offline.

  Web developers familiar with previous attempts to solve the offline problem have reported a deficit of flexibility in those solutions. As a result, the <a>service worker</a> is highly procedural, providing a maximum of flexibility at the price of additional complexity for developers. Part of this complexity arises from the need to keep <a>service workers</a> responsive in the face of a single-threaded execution model. As a result, APIs exposed by <a>service workers</a> are almost entirely asynchronous, a pattern familiar in other JavaScript contexts but accentuated here by the need to avoid blocking document and resource loading.

  Developers using the <a lt="application cache">HTML5 Application Cache</a> have also <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag">reported that several attributes</a> of the design contribute to <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag#section6">unrecoverable errors</a>. A key design principle of the <a>service worker</a> is that errors should *always* be recoverable. Many details of the update process of <a>service workers</a> are designed to avoid these hazards.

  <a>Service workers</a> are started and kept alive by their relationship to events, not documents. This design borrows heavily from developer and vendor experience with <a>Shared Workers</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages">Chrome Background Pages</a>. A key lesson from these systems is the necessity to time-limit the execution of background processing contexts, both to conserve resources and to ensure that background context loss and restart is top-of-mind for developers. As a result, <a>service workers</a> bear more than a passing resemblance to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages">Chrome Event Pages</a>, the successor to Background Pages. <a>Service workers</a> may be started by user agents *without an attached document* and may be killed by the user agent at nearly any time. Conceptually, <a>service workers</a> can be thought of as Shared Workers that can start, process events, and die without ever handling messages from documents. Developers are advised to keep in mind that <a>service workers</a> may be started and killed many times a second.

  <a>Service workers</a> are generic, event-driven, time-limited script contexts that run at an origin. These properties make them natural endpoints for a range of runtime services that may outlive the context of a particular document, e.g. handling push notifications, background data synchronization, responding to resource requests from other origins, or receiving centralized updates to expensive-to-calculate data (e.g., geolocation or gyroscope).

      The lifetime of a <a>service worker</a> is tied to the execution lifetime of events and not references held by <a>service worker clients</a> to the {{ServiceWorker}} object.
      
      A user agent *may* <a>terminate</a> <a>service workers</a> at any time it:

        * Has no event to handle.
        * Detects abnormal operation: such as infinite loops and tasks exceeding imposed time limits (if any) while handling the events.

  <section dfn-for="service worker registration">
    <h3 id="service-worker-registration-concept">Service Worker Registration</h3>

    A <dfn export id="dfn-service-worker-registration" for="">service worker registration</dfn> is a tuple of a <a>scope url</a> and a set of <a>service workers</a>, an <a>installing worker</a>, a <a>waiting worker</a>, and an <a>active worker</a>. A user agent *may* enable many <a>service worker registrations</a> at a single origin so long as the <a>scope url</a> of the <a>service worker registration</a> differs. A <a>service worker registration</a> of an identical <a>scope url</a> when one already exists in the user agent causes the existing <a>service worker registration</a> to be replaced.

      A user agent *must* persistently keep a list of <a>registered</a> <a>service worker registrations</a> unless otherwise they are explicitly <a>unregistered</a>. A user agent has a <a>scope to registration map</a> that stores the entries of the tuple of <a>service worker registration</a>'s <a>scope url</a> and the corresponding <a>service worker registration</a>.

  <section dfn-for="service worker client">
    <h3 id="service-worker-client-concept">Service Worker Client</h3>

    A <dfn export id="dfn-service-worker-client" for="">service worker client</dfn> is a type of <a>environment</a> or <a>environment settings object</a>.

    A <a>service worker client</a> has an algorithm defined as the <dfn export for="service worker client">origin</dfn> that returns the <a>service worker client</a>'s <a>creation URL</a>'s <a for="url">origin</a> if the <a>service worker client</a> is a type of <a>environment</a>, and the <a>service worker client</a>'s <a for="environment settings object">origin</a> otherwise.

    A <dfn export id="dfn-window-client">window client</dfn> is a <a>service worker client</a> whose <a for="environment settings object">global object</a> is a {{Window}} object.

    A <dfn export id="dfn-dedicatedworker-client">dedicated worker client</dfn> is a <a>service worker client</a> whose <a for="environment settings object">global object</a> is a {{DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope}} object.

    A <dfn export id="dfn-sharedworker-client">shared worker client</dfn> is a <a>service worker client</a> whose <a for="environment settings object">global object</a> is a {{SharedWorkerGlobalScope}} object.

    A <dfn export id="dfn-worker-client">worker client</dfn> is either a <a>dedicated worker client</a> or a <a>shared worker client</a>.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="selection">Selection and Use</h3>

    A <a>service worker client</a> independently <a>selects</a> and <a>uses</a> a <a>service worker registration</a> for its own loading and its subresources. The <dfn export id="dfn-service-worker-registration-selection">selection</dfn> of a <a>service worker registration</a>, upon a <a>non-subresource request</a>, is a process of either <a>matching</a> a <a>service worker registration</a> from <a>scope to registration map</a> or inheriting an existing <a>service worker registration</a> from its parent or owner context depending on the request's <a for="request">url</a>.

    When the request's <a for="request">url</a> is not <a lt="is local">local</a>, a <a>service worker client</a> <a>matches</a> a <a>service worker registration</a> from <a>scope to registration map</a>. That is, the <a>service worker client</a> attempts to consult a <a>service worker registration</a> whose <a>scope url</a> <a>matches</a> its <a>creation URL</a>.

    When the request's <a for="request">url</a> <a>is local</a>, if the <a>service worker client</a>'s <a>responsible browsing context</a> is a <a>nested browsing context</a> or the <a>service worker client</a> is a <a>worker client</a>, the <a>service worker client</a> inherits the <a>service worker registration</a> from its <a>parent browsing context</a>'s environment or one of <a>the worker's Documents</a>' environment, respectively, if it exists.

    If the <a>selection</a> was successful, the <a>selected</a> <a>service worker registration</a>'s <a>active worker</a> starts to <dfn export id="dfn-control">control</dfn> the <a>service worker client</a>. Otherwise, the flow returns to <a>fetch</a> where it falls back to the default behavior. When a <a>service worker client</a> is <a>controlled</a> by an <a>active worker</a>, it is considered that the <a>service worker client</a> is <dfn id="dfn-use">using</dfn> the <a>active worker</a>'s <a>containing service worker registration</a>.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="task-sources">Task Sources</h3>

    The following additional <a>task sources</a> are used by <a>service workers</a>.
      
      : The <dfn export id="dfn-handle-fetch-task-source">handle fetch task source</dfn>
      :: This <a>task source</a> is used for <a>dispatching</a> <a>fetch</a> events to <a>service workers</a>.
      : The <dfn export id="dfn-handle-functional-event-task-source">handle functional event task source</dfn>
      :: This <a>task source</a> is used for features that <a>dispatch</a> other <a>functional</a> events, e.g. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#h-the-push-event">push</a> events, to <a>service workers</a>.
        
        Note: A user agent may use a separate task source for each functional event type in order to avoid a head-of-line blocking phenomenon for certain functional events. For instance, a user agent may use a different task source for <a href="http://web-alarms.sysapps.org/#firing-task-event-to-service-worker">task</a> events from other task sources.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="user-agent-shutdown">User Agent Shutdown</h3>

    A user agent *must* maintain the state of its stored <a>service worker registrations</a> across restarts with the following rules:

      * An <a>installing worker</a> does not persist but discarded. If the <a>installing worker</a> was the only <a>service worker</a> for the <a>service worker registration</a>, the <a>service worker registration</a> is discarded.
      * A <a>waiting worker</a> promotes to an <a>active worker</a>.

    To attain this, the user agent *must* invoke <a>Handle User Agent Shutdown</a> when it terminates.

    The user agent *must* create a {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} object when a {{Navigator}} object or a {{WorkerNavigator}} object is created and associate it with that object.

    A {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} provides capabilities to register, unregister, and update the <a>service worker registrations</a>, and provides access to the state of the <a>service worker registrations</a> and their associated <a>service workers</a>.

    A {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} has an associated <dfn for="ServiceWorkerContainer">service worker client</dfn>, which is a <a for="/">service worker client</a> whose <a for="environment settings object">global object</a> is associated with the {{Navigator}} object or the {{WorkerNavigator}} object that the {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} is retrieved from.

    A {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} object has an associated <dfn for="ServiceWorkerContainer">ready promise</dfn> (a <a>promise</a>). It is initially set to a new <a>promise</a>.

    A {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} object has a <a>task source</a> called the <dfn export id="dfn-client-message-queue" for="ServiceWorkerContainer">client message queue</dfn>, initially empty. A <a for="ServiceWorkerContainer">client message queue</a> can be enabled or disabled, and is initially disabled. When a {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} object's <a for="ServiceWorkerContainer">client message queue</a> is enabled, the <a>event loop</a> *must* use it as one of its <a>task sources</a>.

    <a>Service workers</a> and <a href="#extensibility">extensions</a> that <a>define event handlers</a> *may* define their own behaviors, allowing the <a for="ExtendableEvent">extend lifetime promises</a> to suggest operation length, and the rejected state of any of the <a>promise</a> in <a for="ExtendableEvent">extend lifetime promises</a> to suggest operation failure.

    <a>Service workers</a> define the following behaviors for <code><a>install</a></code> event and <code><a>activate</a></code> event, respectively:

      * Adding a <a>promise</a> |f| to the event's <a>extend lifetime promises</a> delays treating the <a>installing worker</a> as <em><a>installed</a></em> (i.e. a <a>waiting worker</a>) until all the <a>promises</a> in the <a>extend lifetime promises</a> resolve successfully. (See step 11.3.1 of <a>Install</a> algorithm.) If |f| rejects, the installation fails. This is primarily used to ensure that a <a>service worker</a> is not considered <em><a>installed</a></em> (i.e. a <a>waiting worker</a>) until all of the core caches it depends on are populated.
      * Adding a <a>promise</a> to the event's <a>extend lifetime promises</a> delays treating the <a>active worker</a> as <em><a>activated</a></em> until all the <a>promises</a> in the <a>extend lifetime promises</a> settle. (See step 12.3 of <a>Activate</a> algorithm.) This is primarily used to ensure that any <a>functional events</a> are not dispatched to the {{ServiceWorkerGlobalScope}} object that represents the <a>service worker</a> until it upgrades database schemas and deletes the outdated cache entries.

    <h3 id="cross-origin-resources">Cross-Origin Resources and CORS</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    <p>Applications tend to cache items that come from a CDN or other <a for="resource">origin</a>. It is possible to request many of them directly using <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements. It would be hugely limiting if this sort of runtime collaboration broke when offline. Similarly, it is possible to <a>fetch</a> many sorts of off-<a for="resource">origin</a> resources when appropriate CORS headers are set.</p>
    <p><a href="#dfn-service-worker">Service workers</a> enable this by allowing {{Cache|Caches}} to <a>fetch</a> and cache off-origin items. Some restrictions apply, however. First, unlike same-origin resources which are managed in the {{Cache}} as {{Response}} objects whose corresponding <a for="response">responses</a> are <a>basic filtered response</a>, the objects stored are {{Response}} objects whose corresponding <a for="response">responses</a> are either <a>CORS filtered responses</a> or <a>opaque filtered responses</a>. They can be passed to {{FetchEvent/respondWith(r)|event.respondWith(r)}} method in the same manner as the {{Response}} objects whose corresponding <a for="response">responses</a> are <a>basic filtered responses</a>, but cannot be meaningfully created programmatically. These limitations are necessary to preserve the security invariants of the platform. Allowing {{Cache|Caches}} to store them allows applications to avoid re-architecting in most cases.</p>

    <p>The implementers are encouraged to note:

        <li>Some of the legacy networking stack code may need to be carefully audited to understand the ramifications of interactions with <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service workers</a>.</li>

    <h3 id="service-worker-script-response">Service Worker Script Response</h3>

    <p>An HTTP response to a <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a>'s <a href="#dfn-script-resource">script resource</a> request can include the following <a>header</a>:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>`<dfn><code>Service-Worker-Allowed</code></dfn>`</dt>
      <dd>Indicates the user agent will override the path restriction, which limits the maximum allowed <a href="#dfn-scope-url">scope url</a> that the script can <a href="#dfn-control">control</a>, to the given value.
        <p class="note">The value is a URL. If a relative URL is given, it is parsed against the script's URL.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="example">
      Default scope:

      <pre class="lang-js">
// Maximum allowed scope defaults to the path the script sits in
// "/js" in this example
navigator.serviceWorker.register("/js/sw.js").then(function() {
  console.log("Install succeeded with the default scope '/js'.");
});
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      Upper path without Service-Worker-Allowed header:

      <pre class="lang-js">
// Set the scope to an upper path of the script location
// Response has no Service-Worker-Allowed header
navigator.serviceWorker.register("/js/sw.js", { scope: "/" }).catch(function() {
  console.error("Install failed due to the path restriction violation.");
});
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      Upper path with Service-Worker-Allowed header:

      <pre class="lang-js">
// Set the scope to an upper path of the script location
// Response included "Service-Worker-Allowed : /"
navigator.serviceWorker.register("/js/sw.js", { scope: "/" }).then(function() {
  console.log("Install succeeded as the max allowed scope was overriden to '/'.");
});
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      A path restriction voliation even with Service-Worker-Allowed header:

      <pre class="lang-js">
// Set the scope to an upper path of the script location
// Response included "Service-Worker-Allowed : /foo"
navigator.serviceWorker.register("/foo/bar/sw.js", { scope: "/" }).catch(function() {
  console.error("Install failed as the scope is still out of the overriden maximum allowed scope.");
});
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

    <p><a biblio data-biblio-type="normative" lt="rfc5234">ABNF</a> for the values of the headers used by the <a href="#dfn-service-worker">service worker</a>'s <a href="#dfn-script-resource">script resource</a> requests and responses:</p>

    <pre>
    Service-Worker = %x73.63.72.69.70.74 ; "script", case-sensitive
    </pre>

    <p class="note">The validation of the Service-Worker-Allowed header's values is done by URL parsing algorithm (in Update algorithm) instead of using ABNF.</p>

  <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
  <!-- FIXME: INCOMPLETE!! Please add collaborators below. -->
  <p>Deep thanks go to Andrew Betts for organizing and hosting a small workshop of like-minded individuals including: Jake Archibald, Jackson Gabbard, Tobie Langel, Robin Berjon, Patrick Lauke, Christian Heilmann. From the clarity of the day's discussions and the use-cases outlined there, much has become possible. Further thanks to Andrew for raising consciousness about the offline problem. His organization of EdgeConf and inclusion of Offline as a persistent topic there has created many opportunities and connections that have enabled this work to progress.</p>

  <p>Anne van Kesteren has generously lent his encyclopedic knowledge of Web Platform arcana and standards development experience throughout the development of the service worker. This specification would be incomplete without his previous work in describing the real-world behavior of URLs, HTTP Fetch, Promises, and DOM. Similarly, this specification would not be possible without Ian Hickson's rigorous Web Worker spec. Much thanks to him.</p>

  <p>In no particular order, deep gratitude for design guidance and discussion goes to: Jungkee Song, Alec Flett, David Barrett-Kahn, Aaron Boodman, Michael Nordman, Tom Ashworth, Kinuko Yasuda, Darin Fisher, Jonas Sicking, Jesús Leganés Combarro, Mark Christian, Dave Hermann, Yehuda Katz, François Remy, Ilya Grigorik, Will Chan, Domenic Denicola, Nikhil Marathe, Yves Lafon, Adam Barth, Greg Simon, Devdatta Akhawe, Dominic Cooney, Jeffrey Yasskin, Joshua Bell, Boris Zbarsky, Matt Falkenhagen, Tobie Langel, Gavin Peters, Ben Kelly, Hiroki Nakagawa, Jake Archibald, Josh Soref, Jinho Bang and Yutaka Hirano.</p>

  <p>Jason Weber, Chris Wilson, Paul Kinlan, Ehsan Akhgari, and Daniel Austin have provided valuable, well-timed feedback on requirements and the standardization process.</p>

  <p>The authors would also like to thank Dimitri Glazkov for his scripts and formatting tools which have been essential in the production of this specification. The authors are also grateful for his considerable guidance.</p>

  <p>Thanks also to Vivian Cromwell, Greg Simon, Alex Komoroske, Wonsuk Lee, and Seojin Kim for their considerable professional support.</p>
